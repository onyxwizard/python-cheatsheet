# 💬 Section 14: Strings

🔤 **Learn how to work with strings in Python**, including raw strings, escape characters, newline handling, and the use of triple quotes for multiline strings.

This section covers:
- How to handle special characters like backslashes
- The difference between regular and **raw strings**
- How to create **multiline strings** using triple quotes
- String immutability and how to modify strings
- Best practices for string formatting using **f-strings**


## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- 📜 How to use **raw strings** to avoid escaping backslashes
- 🧱 Create **multiline strings** using `'''` or `"""` (triple single/double quotes)
- 🔁 Understand that **strings are immutable** — you can't change them directly
- 🎞️ Use **f-strings** for dynamic string interpolation
- 🧩 Escape characters and newline behavior
- 💡 Hidden tips and best practices for working with strings in real-world applications



## 🧵 Raw Strings – Avoid Escaping Backslashes

In Python, the backslash `\` is an **escape character**. But sometimes you want to treat it literally — especially when working with file paths, regex patterns, or URLs.

🔹 **Use Case:** File paths on Windows, regex patterns, etc.

🔹 **Syntax:** Prefix your string with `r`
```python
path = r'C:\new\folder'
print(path)  # Output: C:\new\folder
```

🔸 Without raw strings, `\n` would be interpreted as a **newline**:
```python
path = 'C:\new\folder'
print(path)
# Output:
# C:
# ew\folder
```



## 📄 Multiline Strings – Span Across Multiple Lines

Use triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) to define strings that span multiple lines.

🔹 **Example – Help message:**
```python
help_message = '''Usage: mysql command
-h hostname
-d database name
-u username
-p password'''
print(help_message)
```

🔸 Triple-quoted strings preserve whitespace and line breaks exactly as written.

### ✅ When to Use:
- Configuration blocks
- SQL queries
- Documentation inside code
- Templates



## 🚫 Strings Are Immutable

Once created, you **cannot change a string’s contents** directly.

🔹 **Example – Attempting to Modify a Character:**
```python
s = "Python String"
s[0] = 'J'  # ❌ Raises TypeError
```

🔹 **Correct Way – Create a New String:**
```python
s = "Python String"
new_s = 'J' + s[1:]
print(new_s)  # Output: Jython String
```

🔸 This applies to all string modification operations — always return a new string.



## 🎞️ F-Strings – Embed Variables Inside Strings

F-strings (formatted string literals) were introduced in **Python 3.6** and are now the preferred way to format strings.

🔹 **Basic Example:**
```python
name = 'Anthony'
message = f'Hello, {name}!'
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Anthony!
```

🔹 **Evaluate Expressions Inline:**
```python
a = 5
b = 10
print(f'The sum is {a + b}')  # Output: The sum is 15
```

🔹 **Debugging Aid – Self-documenting Expressions (Python 3.8+):**
```python
x = 10
print(f'{x=}')  # Output: x=10
```



## ⚠️ Common Gotchas with Strings

| Issue | Explanation | Fix |
|------|-------------|-----|
| `\n` not showing | You forgot to include newline manually | Add `\n` where needed |
| `'` or `"` conflict | Mixing quote types causes syntax error | Use different quotes or escape |
| Accidental path issues | Backslashes cause escape issues | Use raw strings `r''` |
| Modifying strings fails | Strings are immutable | Reassign result to new variable |



## 🧩 Escape Characters & Special Sequences

| Sequence | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `\\`     | Backslash     |
| `\'`     | Single quote  |
| `\"`     | Double quote  |
| `\n`     | Newline       |
| `\t`     | Tab           |
| `\r`     | Carriage return |
| `\b`     | Backspace     |

🔹 **Example – Using Escape Characters:**
```python
quote = "He said, \"Hello world!\""
print(quote)  # Output: He said, "Hello world!"
```



## 🧪 Real-World Examples

### ✅ Example 1: Path Handling with Raw Strings

```python
win_path = r'C:\Users\Name\AppData\Roaming'
print(win_path)  # Output: C:\Users\Name\AppData\Roaming
```

### ✅ Example 2: Multiline SQL Query

```python
query = """
SELECT id, name
FROM users
WHERE active = TRUE;
"""
print(query)
```

### ✅ Example 3: F-string for Dynamic Messages

```python
product = "Laptop"
price = 999.99
print(f"Product: {product}, Price: ${price:.2f}")
# Output: Product: Laptop, Price: $999.99
```


## 🧠 Hidden Tips & Notes

- 🧩 Use **raw strings** (`r""`) whenever dealing with:
  - Windows file paths
  - Regular expressions
  - JSON or XML content
- 📝 Use **triple quotes** for:
  - Long help messages
  - Multi-line documentation
  - Embedded scripts or templates
- 🔁 Since strings are **immutable**, any operation like slicing or concatenation returns a **new string object**.
- 🧵 Always use **f-strings** over `.format()` or `%` formatting for better readability and performance.
- 🧹 Be careful with escape sequences — if you don’t need them, prefer raw strings.
- 🧊 For debugging, use `repr()` to see escape characters clearly:
  ```python
  print(repr("Hello\nWorld"))  # Output: 'Hello\nWorld'
  ```



## 📌 Summary

| Feature | Syntax | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Raw string | `r"..."` | Prevent escape interpretation |
| Multiline string | `'''...'''` or `"""..."""` | Span across multiple lines |
| Escape character | `\n`, `\t`, etc. | Insert special characters |
| F-strings | `f"{variable}"` | Interpolate values into strings |
| Immutability | ❌ No direct changes | Always create a new string |
| Debugging | `repr(string)` | See actual escape characters |



🎉 Congratulations! You now have a solid understanding of how to work with **Python strings**, including how to handle special characters, write clean multiline text, and use modern formatting techniques like **f-strings**.
