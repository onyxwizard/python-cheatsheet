## 📦 Introduction to Python Package Index (PyPI)

The **Python Package Index (PyPI)** is the official repository of software for the Python programming language.

🔹 It hosts thousands of open-source libraries and tools contributed by the community.
🔹 You can search for packages using keywords like `requests`, `numpy`, or `pandas`.

### 🔎 How to Search for a Package
1. Go to [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org)
2. Use the search bar to find relevant packages.
3. Click on the package name to view its documentation, version history, and installation instructions.

🔸 Popular packages include:
- `requests` – HTTP requests made simple
- `numpy` – Numerical computing
- `pandas` – Data manipulation
- `flask` – Lightweight web framework



## 🧰 Using `pip` – The Python Installer

`pip` is the default package manager for Python and comes pre-installed with Python 3.4+.

### ✅ Check if `pip` Is Installed
```bash
pip --version
```

If not available, you can usually install it via:
```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```



### 📥 Install a Package
```bash
pip install requests
```

Install a specific version:
```bash
pip install requests==2.20.1
```



### 🔄 Upgrade a Package
```bash
pip install --upgrade requests
```



### 📋 List Installed Packages
```bash
pip list
```

To check outdated packages:
```bash
pip list --outdated
```



### 📦 Show Package Details
```bash
pip show requests
```

Includes info like:
- Version
- Summary
- Author
- License
- Required dependencies



### ❌ Uninstall a Package
```bash
pip uninstall requests
```

You’ll be prompted to confirm before removal.



### 🧹 Freeze Requirements for Reproducibility
Use `pip freeze` to export all installed packages and their exact versions:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This file helps recreate the same environment elsewhere.

🔸 Example content of `requirements.txt`:
```
certifi==2025.1.31
charset-normalizer==3.4.1
idna==3.10
requests==2.32.3
urllib3==2.3.0
```

🔸 To install all dependencies from a file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## 📏 Semantic Versioning Explained

Packages follow the format: `major.minor.patch`

| Part     | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Major    | Breaking changes – not backward compatible |
| Minor    | New features added – still backward compatible |
| Patch    | Bug fixes only – no new features |

🔹 Example:
- `requests==2.32.3` – patch update
- `requests==2.33.0` – minor update
- `requests==3.0.0` – major update (may break existing code)



## 🧪 Why You Need Virtual Environments

When working on multiple projects, different applications may require **different versions** of the same package — which can cause conflicts.

Virtual environments solve this by creating isolated Python environments for each project.



## 📁 Creating Virtual Environments with `venv`

Python has built-in support for virtual environments via the `venv` module (available since Python 3.3).

### ✅ Create a New Environment
```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
python -m venv .venv
```

### 🔌 Activate the Environment

#### On Windows:
```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You’ll see something like:
```
(.venv) C:\myproject>
```

### 🚫 Deactivate When Done
```bash
deactivate
```



## 📦 Managing Dependencies in a Virtual Environment

Once activated, any package installed will be local to that environment.

### ✅ Install a Package in Your Virtual Environment
```bash
pip install requests
```

### 📄 Export Requirements
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### 🧬 Reinstall Dependencies Later
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## 🧱 Alternative: pipenv – Modern Packaging Tool

`pipenv` combines package management and virtual environment handling into one tool.

### 📥 Install pipenv
```bash
pip install pipenv
```

### ✅ Create a New Project
```bash
mkdir crawler
cd crawler
pipenv install requests
```

This creates two files:
- `Pipfile` – lists project dependencies
- `Pipfile.lock` – exact versions used

### 🔍 Check Where the Environment Lives
```bash
pipenv --venv
```

### 🧪 Activate the Shell
```bash
pipenv shell
```

Now your terminal is inside the virtual environment.



## 🧩 Real-World Example – Building an API Client

### 🗂️ Step-by-step:

1. Create a new project folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir api_client
   cd api_client
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install the `requests` library:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

4. Save requirements:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create `main.py`:
   ```python
   import requests

   response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')
   print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
   ```

6. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

7. Exit the environment:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```


## 💡 Hidden Tips & Notes

- 📁 Never commit the virtual environment folder (e.g., `.venv`) to Git — always commit `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.
- 🧵 Prefer `pipenv` or `poetry` over manual `venv + requirements.txt` for better dependency management.
- 🧩 Always activate the correct environment before running your scripts.
- 📝 Use `pip show <package>` to check what a package depends on.
- 🔁 Avoid global installations unless necessary — keep them isolated.
- 🧹 Clean up unused packages with `pip uninstall <package>`.
- 📦 Use `pip cache purge` or `pip cache dir` to manage downloaded wheels.
